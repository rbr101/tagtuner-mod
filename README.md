This is a modified version of the tagtuner from luka6000 -> https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner I modified the STL files with thinkercad so i could fit in a small display.

There is a esphome config part and a homeassistant blueprint to send information to the screen.

I used a small st7789v 240x240 screen, and it shows the currently playing artist/title and when you change the volume.
